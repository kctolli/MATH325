<!-- Instructions:

 Use the Chocolate dataset and a Kruskal-Wallis Test(s) to answer an interesting question(s) that you come up with.
 
 About the dataset:
 
  * Company: Name of the company manufacturing the bar.

  * Orig: The specific geo-region of origin for the bar.

  * Review: Date of publication of the review.

  * Cocoa: Cocoa percentage (darkness) of the chocolate bar being reviewed.

  * Location: Manufacturer base country.

  * Rating: Expert rating for the bar.
      5= Elite (Transcending beyond the ordinary limits)
      4= Premium (Superior flavor development, character and style)
      3= Satisfactory(3.0) to praiseworthy(3.75) (well made with special qualities)
      2= Disappointing (Passable but contains at least one significant flaw)
      1= Unpleasant (mostly unpalatable)

   * Type: The variety (breed) of cocoa bean used, if provided.
   
   * BroadOrig: The broad geo-region of origin for the bean.

## Background 

There are many different Chocolate bars in the dataset. I will be comparing how percent cocoa and rating is compared.  

In this data the each experimental unit is assigned to exactly one factor-level combination. Another way to say this is “one measurement per individual” (no repeated measures) and “equal numbers of individuals per group”.

This test is done using Kruskal-Wallis and One-Way ANOVA. What percent Cocoa has the greatest rating? 

$$
  H_0: \mu_\text{Medium-Chocolate} = \mu_\text{Dark} = \mu_\text{Double-Dark} = \mu_\text{Extra-Dark} = \mu_\text{Super-Dark} = \mu 
$$

$$
  H_a: \mu_\text{i} \neq \mu_\text{for at least one group}
$$

A significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$ will be used for this study.

## Data Analysis {.tabset .tabset-fade}

### Basic Statistics

```{r}
pander(favstats(Rating ~ Cocoa, data = choc)[,-10])
```

### Kruskal-Wallis Test

```{r}
mykruskal <- kruskal.test(Rating ~ Cocoa, data=choc)
pander(mykruskal)
```

```{r}
boxplot(Rating ~ Cocoa, data=choc, type=c("p","a"), col='grey', xlab="Percent of Cocoa", ylab="Rating of Chocolate", main="Rating vs Percent Cocoa")
```

### ANOVA Test

```{r}
myaov <- aov(Rating ~ Cocoa, data=choc)
pander(myaov)
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(myaov, which=1:2)
```

### The Data

```{r, out.width=300}
pander(choc, split.tables = Inf)
```

## Interpretation

In this analysis I compared the percent of cocoa to rating of chocolate. 

Rating is on a 1 to 5 scale. 

1. Unpleasant
2. Disappointing
3. Satisfactory
4. Premium 
5. Elite 

Percent Cocoa is broken into 

* Medium-Chocolate
* Dark
* Double-Dark
* Extra-Dark
* Super-Dark

Over all the Double Dark is the highest rating. We learn from the Kruskal-Wallis that the P-value is 1.462e-18 with 4 degrees of freedom. The P-value is less than the confidence interval so we will reject the null hypothesis.
