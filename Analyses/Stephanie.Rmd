## Background

Stephanie[^1] is a student that will be starting school at BYU-Idaho next semester. Suppose she sent you the following email.

----

"Hi. My name is Stephanie. I would like to learn about what housing options I have for living at BYU-Idaho next semester. It will be my first semester there, so I would like to find something that is close to campus and around $300 a month in rent. I'm not too picky on roommates, but I would like somewhere that has a lot of people around so I can get to know as many people as possible. Thanks in advance!"

Write your response to Stephanie below. Use the "Rent" dataset, good statistical analysis, and clear writing to make some well supported suggestions to her about apartments that meet her stated criterions. You are free to use other criterion that you think she might find more meaningful as well.

## Response

Dear Stephanie,

Here is a list of every apartment option in Rexburg. You would want to just focus on the second table that has been wrangled to fit what you are looking for in an apartment. 

```{r base, warning=FALSE}
# Code to get you started, be sure to use a subset of Rent instead of Rent in this code though.
datatable(Rent, options=list(lengthMenu = c(3,10,30)), 
          extensions="Responsive",
          caption = 'Table 1: Base dataset')
```

```{r numerical, warning=FALSE}
Stephanie <- female_rent %>%  
  select(- Gender, - PrivateRoomPrice, - Price) %>%
  filter(Capacity > 100, MonthlyCost <= 350) %>% 
  select(- UtilityDeposit, - Address, - Phone, - FloorPlans, - Website, - Description, - ParkingStalls, - Latitude, - Longitude, - Deposit, - WalkingMinutes) %>% 
  arrange(MilesToCampus, MonthlyCost, Capacity)

pander(Stephanie, caption = "Table 2: Stephanie's Question")
```

&emsp; The Apartment I would recommend given the data from the table above is Birch Plaza. It fits all you are looking for in an apartment. Birch Plaza has a capacity of 343 which allows you to meet new people. It is .062 miles from campus making it one of the closest apartments to campus. The monthly cost is 280 dollars which is a pretty cheap monthly cost compared to other apartments in Rexburg. 

Below is a picture of Birch Plaza. You can literally see the BYUI Stadium from the parking lot. So it's literally across the street from campus.

This visualization show Birch Plaza as a circle and other apartments as triangles. This graph helps show apartments with respect to distance and cost. We can see that visually Birch Plaza is the best compared to other apartments. In the graph you can see the point for birch plaza on buttom left of the plot. That point shows its the cheapest based on similar distance from campus. 

```{r viz, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
Stephanie %>% 
  mutate(apartmentforyou = ifelse(Apartment == "BIRCH PLAZA", "Birch Plaza", "Other")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = MonthlyCost, y = MilesToCampus, color = Capacity, shape = apartmentforyou, label = Apartment)) + 
  geom_point(aes(size = Capacity)) + 
  geom_label_repel(force = 3, size = 3, nudge_x = 20, nudge_y = .01, min.segment.length = 0) +
  #scale_size_manual(values = c(6, 3)) + 
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title="Apartments of What You are Looking For")
```

I hope this helps.
