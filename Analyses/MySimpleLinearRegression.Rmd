<!-- Directions

Come up with a simple linear regression of your own creation. 

* Write the Background and clearly state your question. Then collect data and perform the linear regression analysis in order to answer your question. Use the proper order of first, ask the question, then second, figure out the answer.

* You should collect both the quantitative response variable and the quantitative explanatory variable yourself. This can be data you collect from 
    - the internet (like weather data, Facebook data, or sports data) 
    - your own experiment 
    - your own observational study
* However,     
    - The data should not be a single pre-existing dataset. It must be something that you piece together yourself.

* You need at least $n=3$ $(X,Y)$ pairs to perform the regression. However, your regression will only be useful if you can get around $n=10$ or more observations.

## Background

What is the relation between Phone screen and Phone price?

In this analysis I will be comparing the relationship between the two. The test used in this analysis is linear regression. I would be interpreted with slope and y intercept.  The slope is interpreted as, “the change in the average y-value for a one unit change in the x-value.” 

There are two equations used in linear regression

$$
  {Y_i} = \overbrace{\beta_0}^\text{y-int} + \overbrace{\beta_1}^\text{slope} * {X_i} + \epsilon_i \quad \text{where} \ \epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)
$$

$$
  {\hat{Y}_i} = \overbrace{b_0}^\text{est. y-int} + \overbrace{b_1}^\text{est. slope} * {X_i}
$$

### Hypothesis

$$
\left.\begin{array}{ll}
H_0: \beta_1 = 0 \\  
H_a: \beta_1 \neq 0
\end{array}
\right\} \ \text{Slope Hypotheses}
$$

$$
\left.\begin{array}{ll}
H_0: \beta_0 = 0 \\  
H_a: \beta_0 \neq 0
\end{array}
\right\} \ \text{Intercept Hypotheses}
$$

## Data Analysis {.tabset .tabset-fade}

### Basic Statistics

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
pander(phone %>% 
  summarise(Correlation = cor(Screen, Price, use="complete.obs")))
```


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
pander(phone %>% 
  group_by(Screen) %>% 
  summarise(avgprice = mean(Price)))
```

### Linear Regression

```{r}
mylm <- lm(Price ~ Screen, data = phone)
pander(summary(mylm))
```

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,3))
plot(mylm, which = 1:2)
plot(mylm$residuals)
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(phone, aes(x = Screen, y = Price)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=FALSE)
```

### The Data

```{r, out.width=300}
pander(phone, split.tables = Inf)
```

## Interpretation

$$
  \underbrace{\hat{Y}_i}_\text{Price} = \overbrace{0.2202}^\text{est. y-int} + \overbrace{0.06784}^\text{est. slope} \underbrace{X_i}_\text{Screen}
$$

The equation above is derived from the linear regression model. From this equation we can find the price of a phone based on screen size. But from the data you can learn that price is not just based on screen size. So this isn't a great model to come to a conclusion for phone price.
