## Making Inferences {.tabset .tabset-pills}

<!-- This is a great place to add general notes --------------- -->

**This comes from the [*Making Inference*](./MakingInference.html) page of this book**

It is common to only have a sample of data from some population of interest. Using the information from the sample to reach conclusions about the population is called making inference. When statistical inference is performed properly, the conclusions about the population are almost always correct.

### Hypothesis Testing

One of the great focal points of statistics concerns hypothesis testing. Science generally agrees upon the principle that truth must be uncovered by the process of elimination. The process begins by establishing a starting assumption, or *null hypothesis* ($H_0$). Data is then collected and the evidence against the null hypothesis is measured, typically with the $p$-value. The $p$-value becomes small (gets close to zero) when the evidence is *extremely* different from what would be expected if the null hypothesis were true. When the $p$-value is below the *significance level* $\alpha$ (typically $\alpha=0.05$) the null hypothesis is abandoned (rejected) in favor of a competing *alternative hypothesis* ($H_a$). 

### Managing Decision Errors

When the p-value approaches zero, one of two things must be occurring. Either an extremely rare event has happened or the null hypothesis is incorrect. Since the second option, that the null hypothesis is incorrect, is the more plausible option, we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative whenever the p-value is close to zero. It is important to remember that rejecting the null hypothesis could however be a mistake.

<div style="padding-left:30px; padding-right:10%;">

| &nbsp; | $H_0$ True | $H_0$ False |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Reject** $H_0$ | Type I Error | Correct Decision |
| **Accept** $H_0$ | Correct Decision | Type II Error |

</div>


#### Type I Error (Significance Level, Confidence and α)

  - Defined as rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true
  - A hypothesis test controls the probability of a Type I Error
  - The typical value of α is 0.05
  - Defined as 1−α or the opposite of a Type I error

#### Type II Errors (β, and Power)

  - Defined as failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false
  - The typical value of β often unknown

#### Sufficient Evidence

Statistics comes in to play with hypothesis testing by defining the phrase “sufficient evidence.” When there is “sufficient evidence” in the data, the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis becomes the working hypothesis.

There are many statistical approaches to this problem of measuring the significance of evidence, but in almost all cases, the final measurement of evidence is given by the p-value of the hypothesis test. The p-value of a test is defined as the probability of the evidence being as extreme or more extreme than what was observed assuming the null hypothesis is true. This is an interesting phrase that is at first difficult to understand.

The “as extreme or more extreme” part of the definition of the p-value comes from the idea that the null hypothesis will be rejected when the evidence in the data is extremely inconsistent with the null hypothesis. If the data is not extremely different from what we would expect under the null hypothesis, then we will continue to believe the null hypothesis. Although, it is worth emphasizing that this does not prove the null hypothesis to be true.

#### Evidence not Proof

Hypothesis testing allows us a formal way to decide if we should “conclude the alternative” or “continue to accept the null.” It is important to remember that statistics (and science) cannot prove anything, just show evidence towards. Thus we never really prove a hypothesis is true, we simply show evidence towards or against a hypothesis.

### Probability and Odds

#### Probability

The probability that an event will occur is the fraction of times you expect to see that event in many trials.

$$
\frac{\overbrace{x}^\text{successes}}{\underbrace{n}_\text{total_attempts}}
$$

#### Odds

The odds are defined as the probability that the event will occur divided by the probability that the event will not occur. 

**Odds for**

$$
\frac{\overbrace{x}^\text{successes}}{\underbrace{n-x}_\text{fails}}
$$

**Odds Against**

$$
\frac{\overbrace{n-x}^\text{fails}}{\underbrace{x}_\text{successes}}
$$


### Calculating the p-Value

Recall that the p-value measures how extremely the data (the evidence) differs from what is expected under the null hypothesis. Small p-values lead us to discard (reject) the null hypothesis.The P-value is the probability of obtaining a result (called a test statistic) at least as extreme as the one you calculated, assuming the null hypothesis is true. 

**A p-value can be calculated whenever we have two things.**

* **A test statistic, which is a way of measuring how “far” the observed data is from what is expected under the null hypothesis.**
* **The sampling distribution of the test statistic, which is the theoretical distribution of the test statistic over all possible samples, assuming the null hypothesis was true.**

A distribution describes how data is spread out. When we know the shape of a distribution, we know which values are possible, but more importantly which values are most plausible (likely) and which are the least plausible (unlikely). The p-value uses the sampling distribution of the test statistic to measure the probability of the observed test statistic being as extreme or more extreme than the one observed.

All p-value computation methods can be classified into two broad categories, parametric methods and nonparametric methods.

### Parametric Methods

Parametric methods assume that, under the null hypothesis, the test statistic follows a specific theoretical parametric distribution. Parametric methods are typically more statistically powerful than nonparametric methods, but necessarily force more assumptions on the data.

Parametric distributions are theoretical distributions that can be described by a mathematical function. There are many theoretical distributions. 

Four of the most widely used parametric distributions are:

* Normal Distribution 
  - It is a theoretical distribution that approximates the distributions of many real life data distributions
* Chi Squared Distribution 
  - It only allows for values that are greater than or equal to zero
  - It has a few real life applications, by far its greatest use is theoretical
* t Distribution
  - A close friend of the normal distribution
  - It is used extensively in hypothesis testing
* F Distribution  
  - It is the ratio of two chi squared random variables that are each divided by their respective degrees of freedom

  - [Car Prices](./Analyses/CarPricesLR.html)
  - [Spotify Consulting](./Analyses/Consulting.html)
* [Chi-squared Tests](./ChiSquaredTests.html)

### Nonparametric Methods

Nonparametric methods place minimal assumptions on the distribution of data. They allow the data to “speak for itself.” They are typically less powerful than the parametric alternatives, but are more broadly applicable because fewer assumptions need to be satisfied.

## Analyses

#### A Quote to Remember

When critiquing other people's work, remember that "The Lord’s way consists of helping people help themselves." <sup>[1](https://www.lds.org/ensign/2015/06/helping-others-in-the-lords-way?lang=eng)</sup> 

<br />

### Rubric Categories

There are five main elements to a good statistical analysis.


* **{ } Questions and Hypotheses**

<div style="padding-left:60px;font-size:.8em;width:80%;">
Does the analysis clearly state its question with proper motivation for why the question is interesting? If the data for the analysis came from a sample, are the proper statistical hypotheses being stated along with the question? (Census data does not require the use of statistical hypotheses.)
</div>

* **{ } Data Analysis**

<div style="padding-left:60px;font-size:.8em;width:80%;">
This is the most difficult part of an analysis to check, but there are two main parts. First, is the analysis technique appropriate for the data? Second, is the analysis properly performed from start to finish?
</div>

* **{ } Graphical Summaries**

<div style="padding-left:60px;font-size:.8em;width:80%;">
A good graphical summary should follow the "stand alone" principal. This means that the graphic communicates all the necessary information all on its own. If it were removed from the analysis, one could still understand what it is presenting.
</div>

* **{ } Interpretation**

<div style="padding-left:60px;font-size:.8em;width:80%;">
This is the most important part of the analysis. Does the analysis reach a conclusion that is soundly supported by data, cited references, or statistical analysis? Does the analysis clearly answer the stated question?
</div>

* **{ } Presentation**

<div style="padding-left:60px;font-size:.8em;width:80%;">
This is certainly subject to opinions on style, but is still a useful criterion to consider. First, does the document flow cleanly from beginning to end? Was it interesting to read? Was it nice to look at? Was it organized? Were colors, fonts, section headers, and other stylistic elements used in a way that improved the reading experience? Did any stylistic elements take away from or clutter up the message that was being delivered?
</div>     

<br/>


### Category Points

Each Rubric Category is graded with a **{0}**, **{1}**, **{2}**, or **{3}**. 
  
<div style="padding-left:15px;">

**{3}** Excellent quality.

<div style="padding-left:60px;font-size:.8em;width:80%;">
This analysis could be included in the Math 325 Notebook as an example of a very well done analysis.
</div>

**{2}** Fair quality.

<div style="padding-left:60px;font-size:.8em;width:80%;">
Some important but not overly dramatic improvements are needed before this could be used as an example of a very well done analysis.
</div>

**{1}** Poor quality.

<div style="padding-left:60px;font-size:.8em;width:80%;">
Some substantial work is needed before this analysis could be used as an example of a very well done analysis.
</div>

**{0}** Element missing

<div style="padding-left:60px;font-size:.8em;width:80%;">
It seems the student forgot to include this element.
</div>

</div>

</br>

Continued resubmissions are expected until you achieve a {**3**} in each Category.
