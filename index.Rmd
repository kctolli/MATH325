## Making Inferences {.tabset .tabset-pills}

<!-- This is a great place to add general notes --------------- -->

**This comes from the [*Making Inference*](./site_libs/MakingInference.html) page of this book**

It is common to only have a sample of data from some population of interest. Using the information from the sample to reach conclusions about the population is called making inference. When statistical inference is performed properly, the conclusions about the population are almost always correct.

### Hypothesis Testing

One of the great focal points of statistics concerns hypothesis testing. Science generally agrees upon the principle that truth must be uncovered by the process of elimination. The process begins by establishing a starting assumption, or *null hypothesis* ($H_0$). Data is then collected and the evidence against the null hypothesis is measured, typically with the $p$-value. The $p$-value becomes small (gets close to zero) when the evidence is *extremely* different from what would be expected if the null hypothesis were true. When the $p$-value is below the *significance level* $\alpha$ (typically $\alpha=0.05$) the null hypothesis is abandoned (rejected) in favor of a competing *alternative hypothesis* ($H_a$). 

### Managing Decision Errors

When the p-value approaches zero, one of two things must be occurring. Either an extremely rare event has happened or the null hypothesis is incorrect. Since the second option, that the null hypothesis is incorrect, is the more plausible option, we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative whenever the p-value is close to zero. It is important to remember that rejecting the null hypothesis could however be a mistake.

<div style="padding-left:30px; padding-right:10%;">

| &nbsp; | $H_0$ True | $H_0$ False |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Reject** $H_0$ | Type I Error | Correct Decision |
| **Accept** $H_0$ | Correct Decision | Type II Error |

</div>


#### Type I Error (Significance Level, Confidence and α)

  - Defined as rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true
  - A hypothesis test controls the probability of a Type I Error
  - The typical value of α is 0.05
  - Defined as 1−α or the opposite of a Type I error

#### Type II Errors (β, and Power)

  - Defined as failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false
  - The typical value of β often unknown

#### Sufficient Evidence

Statistics comes in to play with hypothesis testing by defining the phrase “sufficient evidence.” When there is “sufficient evidence” in the data, the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis becomes the working hypothesis.

There are many statistical approaches to this problem of measuring the significance of evidence, but in almost all cases, the final measurement of evidence is given by the p-value of the hypothesis test. The p-value of a test is defined as the probability of the evidence being as extreme or more extreme than what was observed assuming the null hypothesis is true. This is an interesting phrase that is at first difficult to understand.

The “as extreme or more extreme” part of the definition of the p-value comes from the idea that the null hypothesis will be rejected when the evidence in the data is extremely inconsistent with the null hypothesis. If the data is not extremely different from what we would expect under the null hypothesis, then we will continue to believe the null hypothesis. Although, it is worth emphasizing that this does not prove the null hypothesis to be true.

#### Evidence not Proof

Hypothesis testing allows us a formal way to decide if we should “conclude the alternative” or “continue to accept the null.” It is important to remember that statistics (and science) cannot prove anything, just show evidence towards. Thus we never really prove a hypothesis is true, we simply show evidence towards or against a hypothesis.

### Probability and Odds

#### Probability

The probability that an event will occur is the fraction of times you expect to see that event in many trials.

$$
\frac{\overbrace{x}^\text{successes}}{\underbrace{n}_\text{total_attempts}}
$$

#### Odds

The odds are defined as the probability that the event will occur divided by the probability that the event will not occur. 

$$ Odds for = \frac{\overbrace{x}^\text{successes}}{\underbrace{n-x}_\text{fails}}$$

$$ Odds Against =  \frac{\overbrace{n-x}^\text{fails}}{\underbrace{x}_\text{successes}}$$


### Calculating the p-Value

Recall that the p-value measures how extremely the data (the evidence) differs from what is expected under the null hypothesis. Small p-values lead us to discard (reject) the null hypothesis.The P-value is the probability of obtaining a result (called a test statistic) at least as extreme as the one you calculated, assuming the null hypothesis is true. 

**A p-value can be calculated whenever we have two things.**

* **A test statistic, which is a way of measuring how “far” the observed data is from what is expected under the null hypothesis.**
* **The sampling distribution of the test statistic, which is the theoretical distribution of the test statistic over all possible samples, assuming the null hypothesis was true.**

A distribution describes how data is spread out. When we know the shape of a distribution, we know which values are possible, but more importantly which values are most plausible (likely) and which are the least plausible (unlikely). The p-value uses the sampling distribution of the test statistic to measure the probability of the observed test statistic being as extreme or more extreme than the one observed.

All p-value computation methods can be classified into two broad categories, parametric methods and nonparametric methods.

### Methods 

#### Parametric Methods

Parametric methods assume that, under the null hypothesis, the test statistic follows a specific theoretical parametric distribution. Parametric methods are typically more statistically powerful than nonparametric methods, but necessarily force more assumptions on the data.

Parametric distributions are theoretical distributions that can be described by a mathematical function. There are many theoretical distributions. 

Four of the most widely used parametric distributions are:

* Normal Distribution (Z-Distribution) 
  - It is a theoretical distribution that approximates the distributions of many real life data distributions
* Chi Squared Distribution 
  - It only allows for values that are greater than or equal to zero
  - It has a few real life applications, by far its greatest use is theoretical
* t Distribution
  - A close friend of the normal distribution
  - It is used extensively in hypothesis testing
* F Distribution  
  - It is the ratio of two chi squared random variables that are each divided by their respective degrees of freedom

* [Chi-squared Tests](./ChiSquaredTests.html)
  - [Guns](./Analyses/MyChiSquaredTest.html)

#### Nonparametric Methods

Nonparametric methods place minimal assumptions on the distribution of data. They allow the data to “speak for itself.” They are typically less powerful than the parametric alternatives, but are more broadly applicable because fewer assumptions need to be satisfied. 

##### Nonparametric Tests

  <span class="tooltipRtext">This comes from the <a href = ./PermutationTests.html>Permutation Tests</a> page of this book <br/> Random Testing - A nonparametric approach to computing the p-value for any test statistic in just about any scenario.</span>
</span>
<div id="hovertobegin" style="display:none;padding-left:20px;">

Permutation Tests depend completely on this single idea. If all patterns in the data really are simply due to random chance, then the null hypothesis is true. Further, random **re**-samples of the data should show similar lack of patterns. However, if the pattern in the data is *real*, then random **re**-samples of the data will show very different patterns from the original.

![](./Images/legoPermutationExample.png)

The process of a permutation test is:

1. Compute a test statistic for the original data.
2. Re-sample the data (“shake it up and dump it out”) thousands of times, computing a new test statistic each time, to create a sampling distribution of the test statistic.
3. Compute the p-value of the permutation test as the percentage of test statistics that are as extreme or more extreme than the one originally observed.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#Step 1 Compute a test statistic for the original data.
myTest <- …perform the initial test…
observedTestStat <- myTest$statistic

#Step 2
N <- 2000      
permutedTestStats <- rep(NA, N)
for (i in  1:N){
  permutedData <- …randomly permute the data…
  permutedTest <- …perform test with permutedData…
  permutedTestStats[i] <- permutedTest$statistic
}

hist(permutedTestStats)
abline(v=observedTestStat)

#Step 3
sum(permutedTestStats >= observedTestStat)/N
sum(permutedTestStats <= observedTestStat)/N
```

#### A Quote to Remember

"Knowing a language doesn’t make you a data scientist, just like knowing English doesn’t make you a poet. You will also need to have analytics and visualization capabilities." 

### What is R? 

A successor to the S language with it’s first beta release in 2000. Heavily used by trained statisticians and researchers. Thanks to RStudio (established in 2010), data scientists also use this software for their work.

R allows you to work with data. So, the first step to understanding R is to open a dataset and begin exploring some data. 

If you type the `data()` command into your Console of RStudio you will see a list of "built in" data sets that come with R.

![](./Images/DataOutput.png)

<br/>

The `cars` data set is one of the options that is available. This is a fun "historic" data set from the 1920's. It shows the `speed` and stopping `dist`ance of cars from the 1920's.

To see the `cars` data set in RStudio, use the `View` command as follows.

**Step 1.** Open RStudio.

**Step 2.** Type the command `View(cars)` into your **Console**.

**Step 3.** Press `Enter` or `Return` and the following output should appear within RStudio.

![](./Images/ViewCars.png)

<br/>

Be sure to **TRY IT** yourself, if you haven't already. Good work if you did. It's the only way to learn R. 

Ask someone for help if you aren't sure how to get started.

#### `$` The Selection Operator {#dollar}

<div style="padding-left:15px;">

Once you have a dataset, you need to be able to access columns from it.

**Usage**

`DataSetName$ColumnName`

* The `$` operator allows you to access the individual columns of a dataset. 

<span style="font-size:.8em;">Tip: think of the data set as a "store" from which you "purchase" a column using "money": `$`.</span>

**Example Code**


<a href="javascript:showhide('airqualityDollar')">

#### `<-` The Assignment Operator {#assignment}

<div style="padding-left:15px;">
Being able to save your work is important!

**Usage** &nbsp;&nbsp; Keyboard Shortcut: `Alt` `-`

`NameYouCreate <- some R commands`

* `<-` (Less than symbol `<` with a hyphen `-`) is called the assignment operator and lets you store the results of the `some R commands` into an object called `NameYouCreate`.
* `NameYouCreate` is any name that *begins with a letter*, but can use numbers, periods, and underscores thereafter. To use spaces in the name, you must use \``your Name`\` encased in back-ticks, but this is not recommended.

**Example Code**

<a href="javascript:showhide('NamingCars1')">
<div class="hoverchunk">
<span class="tooltipr">
cars2
  <span class="tooltipRtext">First we name the object we are creating. In this case, we are making a copy of the cars dataset, so it is logical to call it `cars2`, but it could be `bob`, `c2` or any name you wanted to use. Just be careful to not use names that are already in use! </span>

#### c( ) The Combine Function {#cvector}

<div style="padding-left:15px;">
Think of this function as the "back-pack" function, just like putting different books into one back-pack.

**Usage** 

`c(value 1, value 2, value 3, ... )`

* The `c( )` function combines `values` into a single object called a "vector". 
* `values 1, 2, 3, ...` can be numbers or characters, i.e., words, but must be all of one type or the other.

**Example Code**

#### table( ) {#table}

<div style="padding-left:15px;">
This is a way to quickly count how many times each value occurs in a column or columns.

**Usage** 

`table(NameOfDataset$columnName)`

`table(NameOfDataset$columnName1, NameOfDataset$columnName2)`

* The `table( )` function counts how many times each `value` in a column of data occurs. 
* `NameOfDataset` is the ane of a data set, like `cars` or `airquality` or `KidsFeet`.
* `columnName` is the name of a column from the data set.
* `columnName1` and `columnName2` are two different names of columns from the data set.

#### filter( ) 

<div style="padding-left:15px;">

Used to reduce a dataset to a smaller set of rows than the original dataset contained.


**Usage** 

`filter(NameOfDataset, columnName filteringRules)`

* `filter()` is the function that filters out certain rows of the dataset.
* `NameOfDataset` is the name of a dataset, like `cars` or `airquality` or `KidsFeet`.
* `columnName` is the name of one of the columns from the dataset. You can use `colnames(NameOfDataset)` or `View(NameOfDataset)` to see the names.
* `filteringRules` consists of some **Logical Expression** (see table below) that selects only the rows from the original dataset that meet the criterion.
* Controls what rows that are used -- *By Filtering Rows*

<div style="padding-left:30px;">

| **Filtering Rule** | **Logical Expression** | 
|--------------------------------------------|------------|
| Equals one "thing" | `columnName` `==` `something` |
| Equals Any Of Several "things" | `columnName` `%in%` `c(something1,something2,...)` |
| Not Equal (one thing)| `columnName` `!=` `something` |
| Not Equals Any of (several things) | `!columnName` `%in%` `c(something1,something2,...)` |
| Less Than | `columnName` `<` `value` |
| Less Then or Equal to | `columnName` `<=` `value` |
| Greater Than | `columnName` `>` `value` |
| Greater Than or Equal to | `columnName` `>=` `value` |
| AND | `expression1` `&` `expression2` | 
| OR | `expression1` `|` `expression2` |
| Equals `NA` | `is.na(columnName)` | 
| Not `NA` | `!is.na(columnName)` |

#### %>% The Pipe Operator

<div style="padding-left:15px;">
Just like the pipes in your kitchen sink, the pipe operator takes "water from the sink" and "sends it down to somewhere else."

**Usage** &nbsp;&nbsp; Keyboard Shortcut: `Ctrl` `Shift` `M`

`NameOfDataset %>% `

&nbsp;&nbsp;`some R commands that follow on the next line`

* `%>%`, the pipe operator, is created by typing percent symbols `%` on both sides of a greater than symbol `>`. It lets you take whatever is on the *left* of the symbol and "pipe it down into" `some R commands` that follow on the next line.
* `NameOfDataset` is the name of a dataset, like `cars` or `airquality` or `KidsFeet`.

**Note**: you should load `library(tidyverse)` before using the `%>%` operator.

#### summarise( ) and group_by( )

<div style="padding-left:15px;">

Compute numerical summaries on data or on groupings within the data.

**Usage** 

`NameofDataset %>%`

&nbsp;&nbsp; `summarise(nameYouLike = some_stats_function(columnName))`

OR

`NameofDataset %>%`

&nbsp;&nbsp; `group_by(columnGroupsName) %>%`

&nbsp;&nbsp; `summarise(nameYouLike = some_stats_function(columnName))`


* `NameOfDataset` is the name of a dataset, like `cars` or `airquality` or `KidsFeet`.
* `%>%` is the pipe operator that "pipes data" down into R commands on the next line.
* `group_by(...)` is an R function from `library(tidyverse)` that groups data according to a specified column (or columns).
* `summarise(...)` is an R function from `library(tidyverse)` that computes numerical summaries on data or groups of data.
* `columnGroupsName` is the name of a column that represents qualitative (categorical) data. This column is used to separate the dataset into little datasets, one "little dataset" for each group or category in the `columnGroupsName` column.
* `nameYouLike` is just that. Some name you come up with.
* `some_stats_function(...)` is a stats function like `mean(...)`, `sd(...)`, `n(...)` or so on.
* `columnName` is the name of a column from the dataset that you want to compute numerical summaries on.
* Quantitative in Summarize
* Qualitative in Group By

#### mutate( )

<div style="padding-left:15px;">

Transform a column of data.

**Usage** 

`NameofDataset %>%`

&nbsp;&nbsp; `mutate(nameYouLike = some_transformation)`

* `NameOfDataset` is the name of a dataset, like `cars` or `airquality` or `KidsFeet`.
* `%>%` is the pipe operator that "pipes data" down into R commands on the next line.
* `nameYouLike` is just that. Some name you come up with that will be the name of a new column in the dataset.
* `some_transformation` is just that. See the example codes for ideas.
* Create or Transform columns in data

Notice the last two columns of `cyl_factor` and `weight` are what we added to the data set `mtcars2`. As seen by `View(mtcars)`, the original `mtcars` data set did not have these two columns. We used the `mutate` function to create them and saved our work in a new data set called `mtcars2`.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
mtcars2 <- mtcars %>% 
  mutate(
    cyl_factor = as.factor(cyl),
    weight = wt * 1000

pander(mtcars2, split.table=Inf)

#### arrange( )

<div style="padding-left:15px;">

Arrange data by a certain column, or columns, i.e. "sort" the data.

**Usage** 

`NameofDataset %>%`

&nbsp;&nbsp; `arrange(columnName1)`

Note: `arrange(columnName1, columnName2, ...)` is also possible.

* `NameOfDataset` is the name of a dataset, like `cars` or `airquality` or `KidsFeet`.
* `%>%` is the pipe operator that "pipes data" down into R commands on the next line.
* `arrange(...)` is an R function from `library(tidyverse)` that arranges a data set by order for the column given.
* `columnName1` is the name of a column from the dataset that you want to compute numerical summaries on. 
* `columnName2` is the name of a column from the dataset that you want to compute numerical summaries on. 
* `...` implies that you can arrange by as many columns as you want.

#### pander( )

<div style="padding-left:15px;">

Makes output of most commands "beautiful".

**Usage** 

`library(pander)` then...

`pander(someCode)`

OR

`someCode %>%`

&nbsp;&nbsp; `pander( )`

Note: `pander(stuff, caption="Some useful caption", ...)` is also possible.

* `someCode` is exactly that, some coding you have done that creates output that you want displayed nicely.
* `%>%` is the pipe operator that "pipes data" down into R commands on the next line.
* `pander(...)` is an R function from `library(pander)` that makes most R output look nice.
* `...` other useful commands like `split.table=Inf`.

### R Markdown 

Think of an `R Markdown File`, or `Rmd` for short, as a command center. You write commands, then Knit the file, and an html output file is created according to your commands.

#### {.tabset .tabset-pills .tabset-fade}

##### Hide Cheatsheet

The above tabs were created with the code:

    ## {.tabset .tabset-pills .tabset-fade}

    ### Hide Cheatsheet

    ### Show

    Text and image were placed here...

##### Show

Carefully read through all parts of this image to learn...

![](./Images/Rmd2html.png)

#### Creating Links

To make a link use the code `[Name of Link](addressForLink)`. 

Linking to parts of your textbook:

* `[Numerical Summaries](NumericalSummaries.html)` *becomes* [Numerical Summaries](NumericalSummaries.html)
* `[Boxplots](GraphicalSummaries.html#boxplots)` *becomes* [Boxplots](GraphicalSummaries.html#boxplots)

Linking to outside resources:

* `[R Colors](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf)` *becomes* [R Colors](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf)


#### Creating Headers

There are six available sizes of headings you can use in an Rmd file (left in image) that show up as shown below (right in image).

![](./Images/Rmd2html_Headers.png)


<br />

#### Emphasizing Words

To *italisize* a word use the asterisk (Shift 8) `*italisize*`. To **bold** a word use the double asterisk `**bold**`. The back tic ` ` ` can be used to `highlight` words by placing back tics on each side of a word: ` ` ` highlight ` ` `.

<br />

#### Lists {.tabset .tabset-pills .tabset-fade}

##### Simple Lists

<div style="float:left;width:300px;">
To achieve the result:

* This is the first item.

* This is the second.

* This is the third.

</div>

<div style="padding-left:350px;">

Use the code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
To achieve the result:
  
* This is the first item.

* This is the second.

* This is the third.
```
</div>

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

    a. **4**
    
    b. 8
  
2. What is $3\times5$?

    a. 14

    b. **15**

```

</div>
  

##### Tables

There are many ways to [make tables](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_pandoc_markdown.html#tables) in R Markdown. Here is a simple way to make a "pipe" table.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
| Name          | Age           | Gender       | 
|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| Jill          | 8             |  Female      |
| Jack          | 9             |  Male        |
```

| Name          | Age           | Gender       | 
|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| Jill          | 8             |  Female      |
| Jack          | 9             |  Male        |


<br />

#### Insert a Picture

To add a picture to your document, say some notes you took down on paper from class,

Use the code: `![](./Images/insertPictureNotes.jpg)` to get...

![](./Images/insertPictureNotes.jpg)

<br />

#### Themes

Notice in the YAML (at the top of the RMD file) there is a line that reads:

"theme: cerulean"

Other possible themes are

* "default", "cerulean", "journal", "flatly", "readable", "spacelab", "united", and "cosmo".

You can also change the `highlighting` by adding the line "highlight: tango" to the YAML as follows.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
---
title: "Markdown Hints"
output: 
  html_document:
    theme: cerulean
    highlight: tango
---
```

Other highlighting options are

* "default", "tango", "pygments", "kate", "monochrome", "espresso", "zenburn", "haddock", and "textmate".

#### More Information

Go to the [rmarkdown.rstudio.com](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html) website for more information on how to use R Markdown.

<br /> <br /> 

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

### Latex

Latex is used in RMDs to create Math Equations

Use the dollar signs `$x=5$` to write $x=5$ or `$z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$` to write $z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$. For a nicely centered equation use the double dollar signs `$$ $$` on separate lines 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
$$
  z = \frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}
$$
```

to get
$$
  z = \frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}
$$

Or

```{r, eval=FALSE}
$$
  H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2
$$
$$ 
  H_a: \mu_1 \neq \mu_2
$$
```

to get
$$
  H_0: \mu_{\text{Group 1}} = \mu_{\text{Group 2}}
$$
$$ 
  H_a: \mu_{\text{Group 1}} \neq \mu_{\text{Group 2}}
$$

#### Symbol list:

| Symbol | LaTeX Math Code |
|--------|------------------|
| $\alpha$ | `$\alpha$` |
| $\beta$ | `$\beta$` |
| $\sigma$ | `$\sigma$` |
| $\epsilon$ | `$\epsilon$` |
| $\bar{x}$ | `$\bar{x}$` |
| $\hat{Y}$ | `$\hat{Y}$` |
| $=$ | `$=$` |
| $\ne$ | `$\ne$` or `$\neq$` |
| $>$ | `$>$` |
| $<$ | `$<$` |
| $\ge$ | `$\ge$` |
| $\le$ | `$\le$` |
| $\{ \}$ | `$\{ \}$` |
| $\text{Type just text}$ | `$\text{Type just text}$` |
| $\overbrace{Y_i}^\text{label}$ | `$\overbrace{Y_i}^\text{label}$`|
| $\underbrace{Y_i}_\text{label}$ | `$\underbrace{Y_i}_\text{label}$`|
