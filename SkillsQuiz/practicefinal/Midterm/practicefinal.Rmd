![](./practicefinal/Question1.png)

```{r}
t.test(width ~ sex, data = KidsFeet, mu = 0, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.95)
```

## Question 4

```{r}
Util <- Utilities

Util$Season <- cut(Util$month%%12, c(0,2,5,8,11), c("Winter","Spring","Summer","Fall"))

```{r}
util.lm <- lm(gasbill ~ temp + I(temp^2), data=Utilities)
plot(gasbill ~ temp, data=Utilities)
b <- util.lm$coefficients
curve(b[1] + b[2]*x + b[3]*x^2, add=TRUE)
pander(summary(util.lm))
```

![](./practicefinal/Question6.png)

## Question 7

Which of the following would provide the most meaningful title to this graphic?

c

--- Beautiful Summers but Freezing Winters

## Question 8 

Run the following codes in R.

```{r}
U2 <- subset(Utilities, month %in% c(3,6))
plot(gasbill ~ elecbill, data=U2, col=month)
```

Perform an analysis that allows you to place two separate lines on this scatterplot.

Report the p-value of the test of whether these lines have significantly different slopes or not.

```{r}
pander(summary(aov(gasbill ~ elecbill+month+elecbill:month, data=U2)))
```

--- No significant difference in slopes, p-value = 0.8883.

## Question 9 

A group of Math 221 students performed a reseearch project for their class studying the parking abilities of men and women at BYU-Idaho. Essentially, they watched people park and recorded the final parking as "well done", "crooked", or "failed". They also recorded the gender of the person parking the vehicle.

What type of analyses would best help them determine if men or women are better at parking?

--- Chi Squared Test

## Question 10

Suppose the homeowner of the home where the Utilities dataset was collected from approached you with the question: "How much should I plan on my electric bill costing me this July?"

Use the Utilities dataset in R to perform some useful calculations in order to answer their question.

```{r}
pander(favstats(elecbill~month, data = Utilities)[,-10])

U3 <- Utilities %>% filter(month == 7)

pander(favstats(elecbill~day, data = U3)[,-10])
```

Then, select the best answer from the list below.

--- Based on your past data, it looks like you have spent as little as $29.32 and as much as $114.90 on electricity in July. However, 3 out of every 4 bills in July was between $91.55 abd $114.90. So planning on at least $90 is probably a safe bet.

## Question 11

A common mistake of introductory statistics students is to make a graph like the following.

```{r}
barplot(KidsFeet$length)
```

Select the graph from the options below that would be more appropriate for visualizing the distribution of this data.

![](./practicefinal/Question11.png)

## Question 12

Which type of analysis would be best for analyzing the data shown in this boxplot?

![](./practicefinal/Question12.png)
	
--- A Kruskal-Wallis Test

## Question 13

Use the Utilities dataset in R to perform a linear regression that would place a simple linear regression line on this graph.

```{r}
pandary(mylm <- lm(elecbill ~ kwh, data = Utilities))
predict(mylm, data.frame(kwh = 1))
predict(mylm, data.frame(kwh = 2))
predict(mylm, data.frame(kwh = 3))
```

Which of the following correctly interprets the slope of the line from this regression? (You may need to scroll down to see the answer options.)

![](./practicefinal/Question13.png)

--- This homeowner is being charged an average of 10.9 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity used.

## Question 14

Consider the output of a chi squared test performed in R that is shown below. What is the p-value of the test?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
chisq.test(table(gender, groupId))
```

Pearson's Chi-squared test

data:  table(gender, groupId))
X-squared = 4.9575, df = 2, p-value = ________

```{r eval = FALSE}
t.test(mpg ~ cyl, data=mtcars)
```

Which of the following would provide the student with a solution to this error message?

--- Try using kruskal.test(...) instead of t.test(...).

```{r}
kruskal.test(mpg ~ cyl, data=mtcars)
```

## Question 20

Run the following codes in R.
```{r eval=FALSE}
View(mtcars)

?mtcars
```

If a researcher were to use only the hp and vs columns, which type of analysis would NOT make sense to try and perform with this data as it is currently shown?

```{r}
mtCars <- mtcars %>% select(hp, vs)

pander(mtCars)
```

--- A chi-squared Test.

## Question 21

Make a boxplot in R which depicts the length of feet for right-handed and left-handed kids as recorded in the KidsFeet dataset.
